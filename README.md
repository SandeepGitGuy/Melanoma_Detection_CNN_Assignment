# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection using CNN

> Melanoma skin cancer detection involves identifying and classifying melanoma, a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. Melanoma is known for its potential to metastasize and become life-threatening if not detected and treated early.

## Overview
Melanoma skin cancer detection involves the identification and classification of melanoma, a type of skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. Melanoma is known for its potential to metastasize and become life-threatening if not detected and treated early. This project aims to develop a system for the early detection and classification of melanoma skin cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

### Project Objectives
- **Early Detection:** Develop an automated system to assist dermatologists in the early detection and classification of melanoma lesions.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Utilize machine learning models trained on large datasets of skin lesion images to improve diagnostic accuracy.
- **Optimize Model Performance:** Fine-tune the CNN model for accurate and efficient predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** 3.12.2
- **Jupyter Notebook:** 7.4.2
- **Anaconda:** 2023.10
- **Numpy:** 1.26.2
- **Pandas:** 2.1.4
- **Plotly:** 5.18.0
- **Matplotlib:** 3.6.2
- **Git:** 2.42.1
- **Seaborn:** 0.12.2
- **Keras:** 2.15.x
- **TensorFlow:** 2.15.x

## Data Preparation
- **Data Importation:** Import image data and convert it into a suitable dataset format for model training.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Apply normalization and augmentation techniques to enhance model performance and generalization.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize the data to uncover patterns and insights, aiding in better understanding and preprocessing.

## Model Building and Training
- **Model Creation:** Build a CNN model with multiple convolutional layers to extract features from images.
- **Model Compilation:** Compile the model using appropriate loss functions, optimizers, and evaluation metrics.
- **Model Training:** Train the CNN model using the training dataset and validate it using a validation dataset. Implement early stopping and checkpointing to optimize training.

## Model Evaluation
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics.
- **Residual Analysis:** Perform residual analysis to validate model assumptions and ensure robustness.
- **Test Predictions:** Use the final model to make predictions on the test dataset and assess its performance.

## Conclusions
- Efficiently reshaped and preprocessed the data for model training.
- Visualized data to uncover significant patterns and insights.
- Built and trained a robust CNN model for melanoma classification.
- Achieved high accuracy and reliability in classifying melanoma lesions from images.
- Demonstrated the potential of automated systems in aiding early detection and improving diagnostic outcomes.
